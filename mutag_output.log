Loading MUTAG dataset...
Dataset has 188 graphs with avg 17.93 nodes per graph
Average nodes per graph: 17.93
Base nodes: 17, Cayley n: 3, Total Cayley nodes: 27, Virtual nodes: 10
Reference: For average of 17.93 base nodes, would use 10 virtual nodes with Cayley n=3
But we'll be calculating optimal virtual nodes for each graph individually instead
