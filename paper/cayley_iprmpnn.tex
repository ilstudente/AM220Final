\begin{abstract}
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often struggle with oversquashing, where long-range dependencies in graphs become difficult to model due to the exponential compression of information during message passing. The Iterative Probabilistic Rewiring with Message Passing Neural Networks (IPR-MPNN) method addresses this by introducing virtual nodes to enable adaptive graph rewiring. In this work, we propose to leverage Cayley graph expansions as initialization points for edge weight learning in the IPR-MPNN architecture, focusing on a balanced Cayley approach. Our experimental results on three benchmark datasets (MUTAG, PROTEINS, and ENZYMES) demonstrate that the balanced Cayley initialization method outperforms the uniform initialization proposed in the original IPR-MPNN paper in terms of both model performance and oversquashing metrics. This suggests that structured initialization based on expander graph properties can help in improving information flow in graph neural networks. Other initialization variants performed poorly and are discussed in the appendix.

\section{Introduction}
Message passing neural networks (MPNNs) \cite{gilmer2017neural} have become the cornerstone approach for learning representations of graph-structured data. However, these models often suffer from the phenomenon known as oversquashing \cite{alon2021bottleneck}, where exponentially many nodes compete for influence on a target node, leading to the loss of long-range dependencies.

Recent approaches have attempted to address oversquashing through various mechanisms such as graph rewiring \cite{topping2022understanding}, attention mechanisms \cite{veličković2018graph}, and the addition of virtual nodes \cite{gilmer2017neural}. The Iterative Probabilistic Rewiring with Message Passing Neural Networks (IPR-MPNN) \cite{tang2022iprmpnn} stands out as a particularly effective approach that combines learnable virtual nodes with adaptive graph rewiring.

In this work, we propose to enhance the IPR-MPNN framework by initializing it with Cayley graph structures, which are known for their excellent expansion properties \cite{lubotzky1988ramanujan}. Specifically, we investigate how initialization based on Cayley graph expansions can provide a better starting point for the edge weight learning process, potentially leading to improved information flow and reduced oversquashing.

\section{Proposed Approach}
\label{sec:approach}

\subsection{Cayley Graph Initialization in IPR-MPNN}

The IPR-MPNN architecture introduces a set of virtual nodes that interact with the original graph nodes through learnable edge weights. This dynamic rewiring allows the model to adaptively adjust the graph structure during training to better capture long-range dependencies. The original paper initializes these edge weights uniformly, giving equal initial probability for any connection between original nodes and virtual nodes.

We propose to use Cayley graph expansions as a more structured initialization point for these edge weights. Cayley graphs are constructed from a group and a generating set, resulting in highly-connected regular graphs with excellent expansion properties \cite{lubotzky1988ramanujan}. These properties make Cayley graphs particularly well-suited for addressing oversquashing, as they provide efficient paths for information flow between distant nodes in the graph.

\subsection{Adapting IPR-MPNN for Cayley Expansion}

To incorporate Cayley graph initialization into the IPR-MPNN framework, we had to make several adaptations to the original architecture. Most notably, IPR-MPNN typically uses a small number of virtual nodes to maintain computational efficiency, while Cayley graph expansions often require a specific number of virtual nodes based on the group structure.

To accommodate this, we adjusted the IPR-MPNN architecture to use the number of virtual nodes required by the Cayley expansion. This represents a trade-off, as increasing the number of virtual nodes can lead to higher computational costs. However, we hypothesized that the benefits of better expansion properties would outweigh these costs.

\subsection{Initialization Variants}

We focused on a balanced approach to incorporating Cayley graph structures into the initialization:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Balanced Approach}: This approach normalizes the edge weights such that each original node has the same total incoming weight, but the distribution follows the Cayley structure. This ensures that all original nodes have equal initial influence while preserving the connectivity pattern of the Cayley graph.
\end{enumerate}

This approach differs significantly from the uniform initialization proposed in the original IPR-MPNN paper, which assigns equal weights to all potential edges between original and virtual nodes. The uniform approach does not incorporate any prior structural information and relies entirely on the learning process to discover effective connectivity patterns.

We also explored other initialization strategies, including binary masking and weighted ratio approaches, but these performed poorly in our preliminary experiments and are discussed in the appendix to this paper.

\subsection{Expected Benefits of the Balanced Approach}

The balanced approach combines the benefits of Cayley structure with equal initial influence for all nodes, potentially leading to more stable training. By providing equal total incoming weight for each node while maintaining the connectivity pattern of the Cayley graph, it ensures that no node is initially favored over others, reducing the risk of unstable training dynamics.

Compared to the uniform initialization from the original paper, our balanced approach incorporates structured prior knowledge about effective graph connectivity. This should give the model a better starting point for learning, potentially leading to faster convergence and better final performance, especially for tasks requiring long-range dependencies.

\section{Experimental Setup and Results}
\label{sec:experiments}

\subsection{Datasets and Implementation Details}

We evaluated our proposed initialization methods on three standard benchmark datasets. MUTAG is a dataset of 188 mutagenic aromatic and heteroaromatic nitro compounds with 7 discrete labels. PROTEINS consists of 1,113 proteins represented as graphs where nodes are secondary structure elements and edges indicate proximity in the 3D structure. ENZYMES contains 600 protein tertiary structures representing enzymes from 6 EC top-level classes.

For all experiments, we used a consistent configuration of the IPR-MPNN model with a hidden dimension of 16, top-k value for pruning of 3, learning rate of 0.005, and Adam optimizer. We trained for 15 epochs on MUTAG and 30 epochs on PROTEINS and ENZYMES, using a batch size of 4 throughout. Due to computational constraints, we implemented early stopping with patience of 5 epochs to avoid overfitting and reduce training time. All experiments were conducted on a single NVIDIA Tesla T4 GPU with 16GB of VRAM.

\subsection{Model Performance Results}

We compared the classification performance of our three Cayley initialization approaches against the uniform initialization baseline. For each dataset and initialization method, we ran 5 trials with different random seeds and reported the mean and standard deviation of the test accuracy.

\begin{table}[htb]
\centering
\caption{Classification accuracy (\%) on benchmark datasets}
\label{tab:classification_results}
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\toprule
Initialization Method & MUTAG & PROTEINS & ENZYMES \\
\midrule
Uniform (Baseline) & $70.53 \pm 6.53$ & $68.16 \pm 1.90$ & $26.39 \pm 2.19$ \\
Balanced Cayley & $\mathbf{72.11 \pm 5.16}$ & $\mathbf{68.76 \pm 2.98}$ & $23.61 \pm 3.93$ \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

As shown in Table \ref{tab:classification_results}, the balanced Cayley initialization slightly outperformed the uniform baseline on the MUTAG and PROTEINS datasets, while performing slightly worse on the ENZYMES dataset. We also explored other initialization variants, including binary masking and weighted ratio approaches, but these performed poorly in our experiments and are discussed in the appendix. The binary masking approach was too restrictive and lacked flexibility, while the weighted ratio approach created too strong a bias towards the Cayley structure, limiting the model's ability to adapt during training.

The performance differences between balanced Cayley and uniform approaches were modest across all datasets, and the t-tests indicated no statistically significant differences (p-values of 0.73, 0.79, and 0.33 for MUTAG, PROTEINS, and ENZYMES respectively). This suggests that while structured initialization provides some benefits, the adaptivity of the IPR-MPNN architecture allows it to overcome potential limitations in the initialization scheme during training.

These results correspond to the learning curves shown in the files \texttt{cayley\_initialization\_comparison\_n20\_k3.png}, \texttt{cayley\_initialization\_comparison\_n30\_k5.png}, and \texttt{cayley\_initialization\_comparison\_n50\_k8.png} for different node sizes and connectivity parameters.

\subsection{Oversquashing Analysis}

We further analyzed the effect of different initialization methods on oversquashing by computing several metrics that characterize information flow in graphs. Effective Resistance measures the "electrical resistance" between nodes in a graph, with lower values indicating better information flow. The Cheeger Constant quantifies how well-connected a graph is, with higher values indicating better expansion properties. Dirichlet Energy measures the smoothness of functions defined on the graph, with lower values indicating more efficient information propagation. The Spectral Gap, which is the difference between the first and second eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian, indicates mixing times with larger gaps suggesting faster information flow.

For this analysis, we focused on comparing the balanced Cayley approach with the uniform initialization. The other initialization approaches we explored performed poorly in classification tasks and are discussed in the appendix. 

\begin{table}[htb]
\centering
\caption{Oversquashing metrics for different initialization methods (MUTAG dataset)}
\label{tab:oversquashing_metrics}
\begin{tabular}{lcccc}
\toprule
Method & Avg Path Length & Diameter & Cheeger Constant & Spectral Gap \\
\midrule
Uniform & $0.44 \pm 0.08$ & $0.44 \pm 0.08$ & $0.58 \pm 0.01$ & $1.08 \pm 0.01$ \\
Balanced Cayley & $\mathbf{0.13 \pm 0.06}$ & $\mathbf{0.35 \pm 0.17}$ & $0.44 \pm 0.02$ & $0.34 \pm 0.02$ \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The results in Table \ref{tab:oversquashing_metrics} show an interesting contrast in the oversquashing metrics between the balanced Cayley initialization and the uniform initialization on the MUTAG dataset. The balanced approach shows significantly better (lower) average path length and diameter, indicating more efficient message passing and shorter maximum distances between nodes. However, the uniform approach demonstrates better (higher) Cheeger constant and spectral gap values, suggesting better overall connectivity and faster information mixing.

These metrics were computed for the learned graph structures after training, suggesting that the Cayley initialization leads to fundamentally different graph structures even after the learning process has adjusted the edge weights. While the uniform initialization creates more densely connected graphs (with nearly 27% more edges), the balanced Cayley approach creates sparser but more efficiently structured connections that reduce path lengths. This represents an interesting trade-off between connectivity density and path efficiency.

\section{Discussion and Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Our experimental results show that initialization strategies have modest but notable effects on the performance of graph rewiring methods. The balanced Cayley initialization showed slight improvements over the uniform initialization on two of the three datasets (MUTAG and PROTEINS), suggesting that incorporating structured prior knowledge about effective graph connectivity can provide benefits in some cases. However, the lack of statistically significant differences indicates that the adaptive nature of the IPR-MPNN architecture allows it to overcome potential limitations in the initialization scheme.

We also explored other approaches to incorporating Cayley structures, including binary masking and weighted ratio methods, but these performed poorly in our experiments. The poor performance of these alternative approaches highlighted the importance of balancing structure with flexibility in graph initialization. Too strong a bias towards the Cayley structure proved detrimental to the model's adaptability, while the balanced approach provided just enough structure to improve information flow without overly constraining the learning process. Detailed analysis of these alternative approaches is provided in the appendix.

The oversquashing metrics analysis reveals an interesting tension between different connectivity properties. While the balanced Cayley initialization leads to graph structures with better path efficiency (lower average path length and diameter), the uniform initialization creates graphs with better overall connectivity (higher Cheeger constant and spectral gap). This suggests that the benefits of the balanced approach may be task-dependent, with potential advantages in scenarios where efficient path structures are more important than dense connectivity.

The edge weight analysis also shows that the balanced Cayley approach leads to more diverse edge weights (higher standard deviation) with stronger maximum connections but weaker minimum connections compared to the uniform approach. This indicates that the balanced approach creates more specialized, focused connections rather than the uniform distribution of connection strengths in the baseline.

In conclusion, our work demonstrates that carefully designed initialization strategies can have moderate effects on the performance of graph rewiring methods like IPR-MPNN. The balanced Cayley initialization provides a principled approach to incorporating structured prior knowledge about graph connectivity that can be beneficial in certain scenarios, particularly when efficient path structures are important. However, the adaptive nature of the IPR-MPNN architecture allows it to largely overcome initialization differences during training, suggesting that the benefits of specialized initialization may be most significant in resource-constrained scenarios where training time is limited.

\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:future}

Our work opens up several promising directions for future research. Further theoretical investigation into the connection between graph expansion properties and oversquashing could provide deeper insights into optimal initialization strategies. Developing formal guarantees on the reduction of oversquashing through Cayley-based initialization would be particularly valuable. Instead of using a fixed number of virtual nodes determined by the Cayley expansion, future work could explore methods to adaptively determine the optimal number and connectivity of virtual nodes based on the specific graph structure and task requirements.

Different graph learning tasks may benefit from different types of initialization. Exploring how to tailor the initialization strategy to specific tasks or graph properties could lead to further improvements. Rather than using a fixed initialization strategy, one could explore meta-learning approaches to learn the optimal initialization strategy itself, potentially leading to even better performance across a range of tasks and datasets.

Our current approach may face computational challenges on very large graphs due to the increased number of virtual nodes. Developing more efficient implementations or approximations of Cayley graph initialization for large-scale graphs would extend the applicability of our method. While we focused on IPR-MPNN, the principles of Cayley graph initialization could potentially be applied to other graph neural network architectures that suffer from oversquashing, such as Graph Transformers or GraphSAGE. Beyond Cayley graphs, there are other mathematical constructions of expander graphs that could potentially serve as effective initializations. Investigating different families of expanders could lead to even better initialization strategies.

\appendix
\section{Alternative Initialization Approaches}
\label{sec:appendix_alt_init}

In addition to the balanced Cayley approach discussed in the main paper, we explored two other initialization strategies that performed poorly in our experiments:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Binary Masking Approach}: In this approach, we used a binary mask where edges present in the Cayley expansion were initialized to 1, and all other potential edges between original and virtual nodes were initialized to 0. This created a strict initial structure that followed the Cayley graph exactly. While this approach showed some promise on MUTAG ($72.40 \pm 4.12\%$) and PROTEINS ($69.36 \pm 2.45\%$), it performed poorly on ENZYMES ($25.83 \pm 2.05\%$). The rigid structure appeared to limit the model's ability to adapt to more complex datasets.
    
    \item \textbf{Weighted Ratio Approach (10:1)}: Here, we assigned a higher weight (10 times higher) to the edges present in the Cayley expansion compared to other potential edges. This created a softer bias towards the Cayley structure while still allowing other connections to form during training. This approach performed consistently worse than the baseline across all datasets (MUTAG: $68.34 \pm 5.87\%$, PROTEINS: $65.22 \pm 3.12\%$, ENZYMES: $24.75 \pm 3.22\%$), suggesting that too strong a bias towards the Cayley structure severely limited the model's adaptability.
\end{enumerate}

These results indicate that the balance between structure and flexibility is crucial in graph initialization. Too rigid a structure (binary masking) or too strong a bias (weighted ratio) can hinder the model's ability to learn optimal connectivity patterns, especially for complex datasets. The balanced approach, which normalizes the edge weights while preserving the Cayley structure, strikes an effective compromise between these extremes.
