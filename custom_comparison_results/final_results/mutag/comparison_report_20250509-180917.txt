Analysis:
  The Cayley initialization uses a mathematical structure based on the Cayley graph
  to connect base nodes to virtual nodes. This creates a sparse but structured connectivity
  pattern, which may help the model propagate information more effectively across
  distant parts of the graph.

  In contrast, the uniform initialization connects each base node to every virtual node
  with equal weights, which may lead to over-smoothing or less effective message passing.

  The Cayley initialization achieved higher test accuracy, suggesting that the structured
  sparse connectivity pattern is beneficial for the MUTAG classification task.
