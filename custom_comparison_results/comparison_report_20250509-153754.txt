Comparison Report: Uniform vs. Cayley Initialization
==================================================

Test Performance:
  Uniform:
    Test Accuracy: 95.00%
    Test Loss: 0.0829
    Best Validation Loss: 0.0584 (Epoch 18)

  Cayley:
    Test Accuracy: 80.00%
    Test Loss: 0.3930
    Best Validation Loss: 0.1618 (Epoch 27)

Comparative Analysis:
  Accuracy Difference (Cayley - Uniform): -15.00%
  The Uniform initialization achieved higher accuracy.
  Loss Difference (Uniform - Cayley): -0.3101
  The Uniform initialization achieved lower loss.

Conclusions:
  The Uniform initialization outperformed Cayley initialization in both accuracy and loss.
  This suggests that for this dataset, a dense connectivity pattern is more effective.
